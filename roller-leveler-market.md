<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Roller Leveler Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Two-roll</li><li>Multi-roll</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Roller levelers are typically categorized into two types: two-roll and multi-roll levelers. Two-roll levelers are designed with two rolls that rotate in opposite directions to flatten metal sheets by applying pressure. These levelers are simple in design and are best suited for applications where high precision is not required. On the other hand, multi-roll levelers feature multiple rolls that can be adjusted individually to provide more precise and uniform flattening of metal sheets, making them ideal for demanding applications that require high accuracy.</p></p>
