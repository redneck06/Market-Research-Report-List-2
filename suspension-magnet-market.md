<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suspension Magnet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Manual Cleaning</li><li>Self Cleaning</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suspension magnets are commonly available in two types: manual cleaning and self-cleaning. Manual cleaning suspension magnets require the operator to manually remove the captured tramp metal from the magnet surface. On the other hand, self-cleaning suspension magnets have a self-cleaning belt that automatically removes the captured tramp metal, reducing the need for manual intervention. Both types are commonly used in industries such as mining, recycling, and construction to remove unwanted ferrous material from the material flow.</p></p>
