<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Spray Polyurathanes Foam (SPF) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open-Cell (low density)</li><li>Closed-Cell (medium density)</li><li>Closed-Cell (high density)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spray Polyurethane Foam (SPF) is available in three main types: Open-Cell (low density), Closed-Cell (medium density), and Closed-Cell (high density). Open-Cell SPF is lighter and more flexible, offering better soundproofing but less insulation. Closed-Cell SPF, on the other hand, is more rigid and offers superior insulation properties. The medium-density version is often used in walls, while the high-density version is preferred for roofs and outdoor applications where a strong moisture barrier is needed.</p></p>
