<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Quilted Fiberglass Panels Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>One-sided</li><li>Double-sided</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Quilted Fiberglass Panels are available in two main market types: One-sided and Double-sided. One-sided panels have insulation on only one side, making them lighter and more cost-effective for applications where one side will be exposed. Double-sided panels have insulation on both sides, providing better thermal performance and sound absorption. This makes them ideal for applications where both sides need to be insulated, such as in industrial settings or buildings with high sound transmission concerns.</p></p>
