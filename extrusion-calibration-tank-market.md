<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extrusion Calibration Tank Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vacuum</li><li>Non-vacuum</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Extrusion calibration tanks are used in the production of plastic pipes to ensure accurate dimensions and cooling. Vacuum calibration tanks use suction to hold the pipe in place and cool it more efficiently, resulting in high-quality products with minimal warping. Non-vacuum calibration tanks rely on water or air pressure to shape and cool the pipe. Both types have their advantages, with vacuum tanks offering superior cooling and non-vacuum tanks being more cost-effective. Manufacturers can choose the type that best suits their production needs and budget.</p></p>
