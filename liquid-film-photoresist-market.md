<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid Film Photoresist Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Positive Photoresist</li><li>Negative Photoresist</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Positive photoresist refers to a type of liquid film that becomes more soluble when exposed to light, making it easy to wash away the unexposed areas. This is commonly used for fine line patterning in semiconductor manufacturing. On the other hand, negative photoresist becomes less soluble when exposed to light, allowing the unexposed areas to be washed away. This type of photoresist is often used for etching processes where the exposed areas are protected from the etchant. Both types play crucial roles in various manufacturing processes.</p></p>
