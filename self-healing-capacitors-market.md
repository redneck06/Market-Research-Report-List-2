<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Self-healing Capacitors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial</li><li>Axial</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Self-healing capacitors are designed to automatically repair any internal faults that may occur during operation, enhancing their reliability and longevity. There are two main types of self-healing capacitors: radial and axial capacitors. Radial capacitors have leads that come out from the same end of the capacitor body, making them suitable for PCB mounting. Axial capacitors have leads that come out from opposite ends of the capacitor body, making them ideal for through-hole mounting. Both types offer superior performance and durability compared to traditional capacitors.</p></p>
