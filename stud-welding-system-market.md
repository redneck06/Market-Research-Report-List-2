<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stud Welding System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Drawn Arc Stud Welding</li><li>Capacitor Discharge Stud Welding</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stud welding systems have two main types: Drawn Arc Stud Welding and Capacitor Discharge Stud Welding. Drawn Arc Stud Welding uses an electric arc to melt the stud and the workpiece, creating a strong bond once solidified. Capacitor Discharge Stud Welding, on the other hand, uses a high-voltage capacitor to quickly discharge energy through the stud, producing a localized weld. These two methods are commonly used in industries requiring fast and efficient welding of metal studs to various workpieces.</p></p>
