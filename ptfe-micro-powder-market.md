<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The PTFE Micro Powder Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>The original raw material</li><li>Reworked material</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The PTFE micro powder market is categorized into two types: the original raw material market and the reworked material market. </p><p>The original raw material market consists of PTFE micro powder that is produced from scratch using virgin PTFE (polytetrafluoroethylene) resin. This type of powder is considered to have higher purity and quality compared to reworked materials. </p><p>On the other hand, the reworked material market involves PTFE micro powder that is recycled or reprocessed from scraps or waste materials. This type of powder is more cost-effective but may have slightly lower quality and purity compared to the original raw material.</p></p>
