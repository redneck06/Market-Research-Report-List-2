<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Micropiles Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Cased Type</li><li>Uncased Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Micropiles are a type of foundation support system that come in two main types: cased type and uncased type. Cased micropiles have a steel casing that is inserted into the ground, providing additional support and reinforcement. On the other hand, uncased micropiles do not have a casing and rely on the surrounding soil for support. Both types of micropiles are commonly used in construction projects to provide stability and support in areas with difficult soil conditions.</p></p>
