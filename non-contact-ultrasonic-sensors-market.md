<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Non Contact Ultrasonic Sensors Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Open Type</li><li>Sealed Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Non-contact ultrasonic sensors are available in two main types - Open Type and Sealed Type. Open Type sensors are designed without a cover, allowing for easy detection of objects in their path. These sensors are ideal for applications where the sensor needs to be exposed to the environment. Sealed Type sensors, on the other hand, are enclosed in a protective casing, making them suitable for harsh environments where dust, moisture, or other contaminants may be present. Both types of sensors offer reliable and accurate detection capabilities for a variety of industrial applications.</p></p>
