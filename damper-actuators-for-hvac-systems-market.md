<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Damper Actuators for HVAC Systems Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Spring Return Damper Actuators</li><li>Non-Spring Return Damper Actuators</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Spring return damper actuators are commonly used in HVAC systems to control the position of dampers. They are designed to return to their original position when power is removed, providing reliability and energy efficiency. On the other hand, non-spring return damper actuators do not have a spring mechanism and require continuous power to maintain their position. They offer greater flexibility and precision in controlling airflow within HVAC systems. Both types of actuators play a crucial role in ensuring efficient and effective operation of HVAC systems.</p></p>
