<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stem Cell Therapy for Multiple Sclerosis Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intravenous</li><li>Intracerebroventricular</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stem cell therapy for Multiple Sclerosis can be administered through two main markets - Intravenous and Intracerebroventricular. Intravenous administration involves injecting stem cells directly into the bloodstream, where they can travel to different parts of the body including the brain and spinal cord. Intracerebroventricular administration, on the other hand, involves injecting stem cells directly into the fluid-filled spaces in the brain. Both methods aim to help repair damaged nerve cells and reduce inflammation in patients with Multiple Sclerosis.</p></p>
