<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Lentiviral Vector In Gene Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Retrovirus (RV)</li><li>Adenovirus (AdV)</li><li>Adeno-associated Virus (AAV)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Lentiviral vectors are commonly used in gene therapy due to their ability to deliver genetic material efficiently into target cells. Retrovirus (RV) vectors, derived from HIV, integrate their genetic material into the host cell genome. Adenovirus (AdV) vectors are non-integrating vectors that can infect a broad range of cell types. Adeno-associated Virus (AAV) vectors are also non-integrating and have a low immunogenicity, making them attractive for long-term gene expression. Each type of vector has its own advantages and limitations in the gene therapy market.</p></p>
