<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Vehicle Steel Wheel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Casting</li><li>Forging</li><li>Other</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The light vehicle steel wheel market can be categorized into three main types: casting, forging, and other. Casting involves pouring molten steel into a mold to form the wheel, resulting in a smooth finish and precise dimensions. Forging, on the other hand, involves shaping the steel through compressive forces, resulting in a stronger and more durable wheel. The "other" category may include alternative manufacturing methods such as spinning or flow forming. Each type has its own advantages and is chosen based on specific requirements and preferences.</p></p>
