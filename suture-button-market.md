<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Suture Button Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable</li><li>Non-absorbable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Suture buttons are used in orthopedic surgeries to fixate tendons and ligaments to bones. There are two main types of suture buttons: absorbable and non-absorbable. Absorbable suture buttons are made of materials that dissolve over time, eliminating the need for removal. They are typically used in procedures where long-term fixation is not required. Non-absorbable suture buttons, on the other hand, are made of materials that remain in the body indefinitely and provide permanent fixation. Surgeons choose between the two types based on the specific needs of the patient and the nature of the procedure.</p></p>
