<p><h1>Active and Passive Sonar System Market Insights, Market Players and Forecast Till 2031</h1></p><p><strong>Active and Passive Sonar System Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Active sonar systems emit pulses of sound waves into the water and listen for their echoes to detect objects underwater. These systems actively transmit signals and analyze the returning echoes to determine the presence, location, and characteristics of underwater targets. Passive sonar systems, on the other hand, only listen for sounds in the water without emitting any signals. They rely on detecting signals emitted by other sources such as ships or submarines to gather information about underwater activities.</p><p>The Active and Passive Sonar System Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 11.9% during the forecast period. The market growth is driven by increasing defense budgets of countries, rising investments in modernizing naval fleets, and growing maritime security concerns worldwide. Technological advancements in sonar systems, such as the integration of artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms for enhanced performance, are also contributing to the market's growth.</p><p>The latest trends in the Active and Passive Sonar System Market include the development of advanced sonar technologies for improved underwater surveillance and detection capabilities, the introduction of compact and lightweight sonar systems for unmanned underwater vehicles (UUVs), and the deployment of integrated sonar solutions for multi-mission naval platforms. These trends are expected to drive the market's growth and shape the future of underwater acoustic sensing systems.</p></p>
